#Reflection

##Advice to self if I did the project agian
- Use the christmas break more to reduce the grind at the end of the semester
- Create a hierarchy of needs to know what the most important thing to work on is 

##Did I complete the needs to have list?
- I completed everything on the needs to have list 
- I did not complete everything on the nice to have list, due to time restraints and maybe too much ambition?

##Hardest part of the project
- The hardest parts of this project was the movement and collision detection of pieces, and clearing/shifting down lines which required research(see clearLine Function)
- Hold function was another that took some work. This project really helped expand my knowledge of OOP and Arrays in Javascript
